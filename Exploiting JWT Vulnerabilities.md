# Penetration Testing: Exploiting JWT Vulnerabilities

## Introduction

JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are commonly used in web applications for authentication and session management. While JWTs provide a compact and self-contained way to transmit information, security issues arise when they are improperly implemented or misconfigured. These issues can lead to various attacks, such as token forgery, unauthorized access, and privilege escalation, which make JWT security critical for protecting web applications.

### Key Points
1. **Authentication Risks**: JWTs can be exploited to bypass authentication controls, allowing attackers to impersonate users or escalate privileges.
2. **Session Hijacking**: Insecure JWT storage or transmission can lead to session hijacking attacks.
3. **Token Forgery**: Poor implementation of JWT signature verification allows attackers to forge tokens.
4. **Token Tampering**: Vulnerabilities in algorithms or key management can allow attackers to modify JWTs.
5. **Sensitive Information Leakage**: Poorly secured JWTs may expose sensitive information, leading to privacy violations.

## JWT Vulnerability Pentesting Checklist

### 1. **Unverified Signature**
   - **Vulnerability**: The JWT signature is not properly verified.
   - **How to Find**: Remove or tamper with the JWT signature and check if the application accepts it.
   - **Example**:
     ```json
     {
       "alg": "none"
     }
     ```
     Send this unsigned token and observe if access is still granted.

### 2. **None Algorithm Bypass**
   - **Vulnerability**: The server accepts JWTs signed with the `none` algorithm, which bypasses signature verification.
   - **How to Find**: Change the `alg` header to `none` and remove the signature, then try to use the token.
   - **Example**:
     Header:
     ```json
     {
       "alg": "none"
     }
     ```
     Token: 
     ```
     eyJhbGciOiJub25lIn0.eyJpc3MiOiJleGFtcGxlIn0.
     ```

### 3. **Weak Secret Key (HS256)**
   - **Vulnerability**: Weak or guessable HMAC secret key is used for signing JWTs.
   - **How to Find**: Attempt to brute-force the HMAC secret using tools like `hashcat` or `jwt-cracker`.
   - **Example**:
     ```bash
     hashcat -a 0 -m 16500 <jwt_token> <wordlist>
     ```

### 4. **Algorithm Confusion (RS256 to HS256)**
   - **Vulnerability**: Switching the algorithm from `RS256` (asymmetric) to `HS256` (symmetric) and signing with the server's public key.
   - **How to Find**: Modify the algorithm in the header from `RS256` to `HS256`, then sign the token with the server's public key as the HMAC secret.
   - **Example**:
     Original header:
     ```json
     {
       "alg": "RS256"
     }
     ```
     Modified header:
     ```json
     {
       "alg": "HS256"
     }
     ```

### 5. **Algorithm Confusion Attacks**
   - **Vulnerability**: Attackers exploit algorithm confusion by forcing the server to verify a JWT using a different algorithm than intended. This can allow them to forge valid JWTs without knowing the server's secret key.
   - **How to Find**: Change the `alg` header from `RS256` to `HS256`, sign the token using the server’s public key as the HMAC secret, and attempt to use the token.
   - **Symmetric vs Asymmetric Algorithms**:
     - Symmetric algorithms like `HS256` use a single secret key to both sign and verify the token.
     - Asymmetric algorithms like `RS256` use a private key for signing and a public key for verification.
   - **Example**: Attackers can exploit the fact that the server may treat the public key (for verifying an asymmetric token) as the HMAC secret (for verifying a symmetric token). By creating a forged token signed with the public key and modifying the algorithm to `HS256`, the server will use the same public key to verify the signature.
     ```json
     {
       "alg": "HS256"
     }
     ```

     **Steps for Performing an Algorithm Confusion Attack**:
     1. Obtain the server’s public key (e.g., from `/jwks.json`).
     2. Convert the public key to a suitable format (like X.509 PEM).
     3. Modify the JWT's payload and set the `alg` to `HS256`.
     4. Sign the JWT using the `HS256` algorithm and the public key as the secret.
     
     **Example JWK Endpoint**:
     ```json
     {
       "keys": [
         {
           "kty": "RSA",
           "kid": "75d0ef47-af89-47a9-9061-7c02a610d5ab",
           "n": "o-yy1wpYmffgXBxhAUJzHHocCuJolwDqql75ZWuCQ_cb33K2vh9mk6GPM9gNN4Y_qTVX67WhsN3JvaFYw-fhvsWQ"
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

### 6. **Key Injection via `kid` Header**
   - **Vulnerability**: Key ID (`kid`) parameter is vulnerable to directory traversal or arbitrary file inclusion, allowing signature bypass.
   - **How to Find**: Try injecting file paths into the `kid` parameter, e.g., `/dev/null`, and sign the token with an empty key.
   - **Example**:
     ```json
     {
       "kid": "../../../../../../dev/null",
       "alg": "HS256"
     }
     ```

### 7. **JWK Header Injection**
   - **Vulnerability**: Injecting a custom public key via the `jwk` header to trick the server into verifying the token using the attacker's key.
   - **How to Find**: Add a `jwk` parameter containing an attacker's public key in the JWT header.
   - **Example**:
     ```json
     {
       "alg": "RS256",
       "jwk": {
         "kty": "RSA",
         "n": "<your-public-key-modulus>",
         "e": "AQAB"
       }
     }
     ```

### 8. **JWK Set URL (`jku`) Injection**
   - **Vulnerability**: The `jku` header allows the server to retrieve a malicious key set from an arbitrary URL controlled by the attacker.
   - **How to Find**: Insert a custom `jku` header pointing to a malicious JWK Set hosted on a controlled server.
   - **Example**:
     ```json
     {
       "alg": "RS256",
       "jku": "http://attacker.com/jwks.json"
     }
     ```

### 9. **Replay Attack**
   - **Vulnerability**: JWTs are reused without proper invalidation, leading to session hijacking.
   - **How to Find**: Capture a valid JWT and try reusing it after the user logs out or the session should be invalid.
   - **Example**: Replay the same JWT after a logout event. If the server still accepts it, the application is vulnerable.

### 10. **Expired or Invalid Token Acceptance**
   - **Vulnerability**: The server accepts expired or tampered tokens without proper validation.
   - **How to Find**: Modify the `exp` (expiration) claim to a past time or tamper with claims and check if the token is still valid.
   - **Example**:
     ```json
     {
       "exp": 1600000000
     }
     ```

### 11. **JWT Stored in Local Storage (XSS Risk)**
   - **Vulnerability**: Storing JWTs in browser local storage exposes them to XSS attacks.
   - **How to Find**: Look for JWTs stored in local storage using browser developer tools or attempt an XSS payload injection.
   - **Example**: If an XSS vulnerability exists, an attacker can execute:
     ```javascript
     console.log(localStorage.getItem("jwt_token"));
     ```

### 12. **JWT in URL (Leakage via Referrer Headers)**
   - **Vulnerability**: Storing JWTs in URLs (e.g., as a query parameter) exposes them to referrer leakage.
   - **How to Find**: Check if the JWT is passed in the URL, and inspect HTTP headers to see if the referrer leaks the token.
   - **Example**:
     ```
     https://example.com?token=eyJhbGciOi...
     ```

### 13. **Insecure Token Revocation**
   - **Vulnerability**: The server does not properly revoke JWTs, allowing them to remain valid even after logout or expiration.
   - **How to Find**: Attempt to reuse a token after the session is terminated, and check if it is still accepted.
   - **Example**: Use a captured JWT after the user has logged out and observe if access is still granted.

## How to Prevent JWT Attacks

You can protect your websites against many JWT-related vulnerabilities by taking the following high-level measures:

- **Use an up-to-date JWT library**: Ensure your developers understand how the library works and are aware of its security implications. Modern libraries minimize security risks, but their inherent flexibility still leaves room for misuse.
- **Enforce strict signature verification**: Always verify the signature of JWTs you receive, and be mindful of edge cases like tokens signed using unexpected algorithms.
- **Restrict the `jku` header**: Implement a strict whitelist of permitted hosts for the `jku` header to avoid injection or unauthorized access.
- **Secure the `kid` header**: Prevent path traversal and SQL injection attacks by properly validating and sanitizing the `kid` header parameter.

## Additional Best Practices for JWT Handling

Although not strictly necessary, these best practices can help improve security when using JWTs:

- **Set an expiration date** for all issued tokens to limit their lifetime and reduce the impact of compromised tokens.
- **Avoid sending tokens via URL parameters**: Tokens in URL parameters are more likely to be exposed in logs or referrer headers.
- **Use the `aud` claim**: Include an audience claim (or similar) to define the intended recipient, preventing tokens from being reused on other websites.
- **Enable token revocation**: Ensure your system can revoke tokens, such as during logout, to maintain security after a session ends.

  ## Conclusion

Pentesting JWT implementations is critical in securing web applications, as JWT vulnerabilities can lead to authentication bypass, privilege escalation, session hijacking, and exposure of sensitive data. By systematically testing the token's signature verification process, key management, and storage methods, security professionals can identify and mitigate these risks effectively.
